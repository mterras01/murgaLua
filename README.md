# murgaLua
Various murgaLua scripts :
- test_HQL.lua reads a bunch of Hibernate Queries recorded in file "requetes_HQL_for_analyse_240521.txt" for doing some stats: how many queries including patient, sejour, prescription, constante, plan de soin etc... with some charts for vizualisation.
- test_charts.lua reads a csv file of your choice, with ";" as separator and does some stats and charts visualization.
- As for murgaLua, charts methods & functions are very very very few documented...

murgaLua is a (very great) language based on Lua, and embedding fltk
