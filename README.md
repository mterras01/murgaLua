# murgaLua
Various murgaLua scripts :</br>
- test_HQL.lua reads a bunch of Hibernate Queries recorded in file "requetes_HQL_for_analyse_240521.txt" for doing some stats: how many queries including patient, sejour, prescription, constante, plan de soin etc... with some charts for vizualisation.</br>
- test_charts.lua reads a csv file of your choice, with ";" as separator and does some stats and charts visualization. As for murgaLua, charts methods & functions are very very very few documented, so i think this demo could help...</br>
- wordcloud.lua makes a graphical wordcloud from a text or csv file (work in progress).</br>


murgaLua is a (very great) language based on Lua, and embedding fltk</br>
